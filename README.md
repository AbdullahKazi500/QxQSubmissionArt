a project on CRISPR and quantum computing, there would definitely be more areas that I would have liked to explore if I had more time. For instance, I would have loved to investigate the potential of quantum computing in optimizing CRISPR's off-target effects, and also look at how the combination of the two technologies could lead to a better understanding of complex genetic diseases.

One of the major challenges in this project is the complexity of both CRISPR and quantum computing. It requires a deep understanding of both fields, which can be quite daunting. Additionally, the lack of access to quantum computers for most people makes it difficult to experiment and implement these ideas in practice.

If I had to do something differently, I would have spent more time explaining some of the technical concepts to make it easier for non-experts to follow along.

This project connects to various course concepts, such as linear algebra, quantum mechanics, and biochemistry. It highlights how knowledge from these fields can be combined to address complex problems in genetic engineering.

The project relates to the societal and ethical impact of quantum computing and AI on the future, as it shows how these technologies can potentially revolutionize the field of genetics and impact healthcare, agriculture, and environmental conservation. It is important to consider the ethical implications of such advancements, such as issues related to genetic modification and access to these technologies.

What I most enjoyed about this project was learning about the potential of quantum computing in the field of genetics and how it can be combined with CRISPR technology to solve complex problems. It was fascinating to explore the theoretical aspects of the topic and to see how these technologies can be applied in practice.
